# What is Customer Segmentation?
Customer Segmentation is the process of division of customer base into several groups of individuals that share a similarity in different ways that are relevant to marketing such as gender, age, interests, and miscellaneous spending habits. 
Companies that deploy customer segmentation are under the notion that every customer has different requirements and require a specific marketing effort to address them appropriately.
